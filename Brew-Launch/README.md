Brew Launch
================

Requires: http://brew.sh/ and http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/

After installing this Alfred Workflow, all you need to do is enter "bl {formula}" into Alfred to quickly execute Brewâ€™s update command (to see if there are any new or updated packages), upgrade command (to upgrade any installed packages), cleanup command (to remove old packages), and doctor command (to confirm that Brew is operating properly), then finally launch the entered formula all in one shot.

Examples: `bl inkscape` to launch Inkscape after running updates, or `bl keybase encrypt morgan -s -m 'stuff to encrypt'` to sign and encrypt a message to Morgan after running updates.
