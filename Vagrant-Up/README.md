Vagrant Up
================

Requires: https://www.vagrantup.com/ and https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/

After installing this Alfred Workflow, all you need to do is enter "vu" into Alfred to quickly change the directory to vagrant-local and run the vagrant up command to launch Vagrant.

Example: `vu` to do everything described above, it's really that simple.

Made especially for users of https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV who forget to `cd vagrant-local` every single time, like me.
